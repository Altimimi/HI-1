## Briefly about us
Our project focuses on quantum cryptography. We tried to create a library for quantum computing. Using known protocols such as BB84 and Sarg04 and programming language Python we have made a quantum key distribution algorithm, encrypt the key itself, tried to restore it with the host as an example

## Our purpose
Our library is universal and is designed for a variety of quantum computations and operations on qubits
